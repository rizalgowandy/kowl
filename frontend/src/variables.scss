/*
    In index.tsx we use ConfigProvider to define theme color(s),
    from which a whole pallete of css-variables become defined.

        --ant-primary-color
        --ant-primary-color-disabled
        --ant-primary-color-hover
        ... (20 more)

    Full list of variables:
        node_modules/antd/dist/antd.variable.css

    In our own components we want to use the same colors that ant-design uses.
    So we define our own css variables and copy the antd values.
